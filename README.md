New to Git...  I'm out of school and attempting to build a production application, or an environment to run many applications.  As I stumble across new subjects  I will post to this repository brief.  Or I will at least post a brief description of a resource and a link to an external site.  e.g. nginx is an http server that is capable of reverse proxy.  Use this to delegate traffic to and from web applications built for customers.  Documentation may be found at https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/.  

Programs and Software of Interest:
* Ubuntu Sever 16.04 - For now this is the server of choice for my applications.  The server edition of ubuntu is my prime choice because it does not have a graphical user interface.  Documentation about the ubuntu server may be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/.
* MEAN Stack -  What a wonderful set.  Google this and prepare to be blown away.
* nginx - http server that is capable of reverse proxy.  Use this to delegate traffic to and from web applications built for customers.  Documentation may be found at https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/.  
* Form.io - This was the first open source code that I actual took a look at.  If I had seen videos published by Travis Tidwell, I would still be attempting to create a dynamic RESTful api based on mongoose schemas.  Take a look at the form.io website (https://form.io/) as well as some of the videos on youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY_Uc6oW8Zsbwhn-LbzGSaw.
* Git - duh.
* Javascript - My main goal is to setup a development environment that is exclusive to this language.  With the exceptions of html, but it's more of a domain specific language.


Forgive me if I do not meet any unofficial community guidelines, as I'm a noobie at this.  As I read documentation and observe the behavior of others I will adjust the post and outline of this document, and all other that I may publish...
